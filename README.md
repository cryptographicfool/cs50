# Backup of Harvard cs50x 2019 Problem Sets.

I will be updating these as and when I go through the problem sets. The repository is a work in progress. (Lecture and notes files are included in each folder for the specific week.)

## week_0 - pset0

In week zero, I was introduced to the basics of how a computer works as well as introduces to visual programing using scratch.

### chest_ninja - game
I used scratch and made a simple single level dungeon game in scratch, you need to collect potions as well as avoid goblins, slime and flies in order to reach the chest and win the game.

You can play the game [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/317471408/).

## week_1 - pset1
In week one I was introduced to the basics of language C. Following are the problems that I worked on.

### mario_less.c
A program that recreates half-pyramid from mario game using hashes (#) instead of blocks.

### mario_more.c
A program that creates double half-pyramid from mario game using hashes (#) instead of blocks.

### cash.c
A program to count minimum number of coins needed to give user the required change using greedy algorithm.

### credit.c
A program to check if a credit card number is valid, and whether it is a MasterCard, VISA or an AmEx card.

## week_2 - pset2
In week two I was introduced to arrays, strings and functions in C. I also learned about debugging and how compilers work. Following are the problems that I worked on.

### caesar.c
A program that converts plaintext input to ciphertext using a key provided by the user. This program is based on Caesar Cipher and takes numerical key.

### vigenere.c
A program that converts plaintext input to ciphertext using a key provided by the user. This program is based on Vigenere Cipher and takes a set of alphabets as the key.

### crack.c
A program that takes hashed password as an input and outputs password in plain text. This is based on C's DES based crypt function.
