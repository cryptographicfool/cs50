I will be updating these as and when I go through the problem sets. The repository is a work in progress. (Lecture and notes files are included in each folder for the specific week.)

## week_0 - pset0

I used scratch and made a simple single level dungeon game in scratch, you need to collect potions as well as avoid goblins, slime and flies in order to reach the chest and win the game.

You can play the game [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/317471408/).
